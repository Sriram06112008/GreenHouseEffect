<h3> What is Greenhouse Effect </h3>
<hr size = "5" align = "centre"  width = "25">
<p>The greenhouse effect is the process by which radiation from a planet's atmosphere warms the planet's surface to a temperature above what it would <br>
be without this atmosphere</p>
<p>Radiatively active gases (i.e., greenhouse gases) in a planet's atmosphere radiate energy in all directions. Part of this radiation <br> is directed towards the surface, thus warming it.<br> The intensity of downward radiation – that is, the strength of the greenhouse effect – depends on the amount of greenhouse gases that the atmosphere contains. The temperature rises until the intensity of upward radiation from the surface,<br> thus cooling it, balances the downward flow of energy.</p>
